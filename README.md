# Clustering and Decision Trees for Exploratory Data Analysis

This demonstration shows the process of how to use **KMeans Clustering** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis** on a dataset in order to understand and group the data.

**Decision Trees** are a supervised machine learning technique that can be used to interpet the KMeans Clustering output in order to understand how to data was separated and grouped.

**Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** are used to visualize the results to users

This process will also show how the optimal # of clusters is found and how to extract feature importances relative to clustering
